This year has been one to forget!
But 2020 did have its bright spots, especially in the PSL community.
This post reviews some of the highlights from the year.

The Library was able to welcome two new models to the catalog this year: [microdf](https://github.com/PSLmodels/microdf) and [OpenFisca-UK](https://github.com/PSLmodels/openfisca-uk).
microdf provides a number of useful tools for use with economic survey data.
OpenFisca-UK builds off the [OpenFisca](https://openfisca.org/en/) platform, offering a microsimulation models for tax and benefit programs in the UK.

In addition, four new models were added to the Library as incubating projects.  The [ui-calculator](https://github.com/PSLmodels/ui_calculator) model has received a lot of attention this year in the U.S., as it provides the capability to calculate unemployment insurance benefits across U.S. states, a major mode of delivering financial relief to individuals during the COVID crisis. 
[PCI-Outbreak](https://github.com/PSLmodels/PCI-Outbreak) directly relates to the COVID crisis, using machine learning and natural language processing to estimate the true degrees of COVID cases in China.
The model finds that actual cases are significantly higher than what official statistics claim.
The [COVID-MCS](https://github.com/PSLmodels/COVID-MCS) model considers COVID case and test positivity rates to measure whether or not communities are meeting certain benchmarks in controlling the spread of the disease.
On a lighter note, the [Git-Tutorial](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Git-Tutorial) project provides instruction and resources for learning to use Git and GitHub, with an emphasis on the workflow used by many projects in the PSL community.
